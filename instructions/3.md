# Step 3 - Model Training and Inference

Now that we have features, we need to predict the future with them. (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html)
We are going to do *online training* - this means that we will be fitting our algorithm while we predict. In fact, we will fit our system on every tick that we take action.
In order to do this, we will need to accumulate targets (Return 1s) and then fit our Lasso on the accumulated targets. 

Our train length with be 10 ticks. This implies:
Before we have 10 X Y pairs, we will not perform any predictions. 
After we have 10 X Y pairs, we will need to remove the latest pairs to keep us at 10 pairs when predicting. 

After we update our datasets, we will need to fit the model, and then perform inference. 

Be aware that there is a desync - at time = 11, we only have the targets from t = 1 to t = 10. This means that we will train on the x values from
t = 1 to t = 10, and then predict using the x values for x = 11.

Be sure to write unit tests for the functionality of your buffer. It is not recommended to test model outputs - more sophisticated models
will have random elements which will make it very difficult to test the outputs. Asserting that an output is non-None is a good idea though.
